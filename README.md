# MonteCarloSimulation
The Monte Carlo Simulation is a test designed to predict results using random sampling.
For pi, we will be using a square that encompasses a circle. After this, we will randomly generate points inside the square 
and utilise the ratio between the number of points falling inside the circle and the total number of squares
More information about the calculation and the ratio can be found here - 
This program has 2 codes 
1. Serial Implementation
2. Parallel Implementation

The Run Time of these 2 seperate codes will demonstrate the speedup
